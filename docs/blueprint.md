## Style Guidelines:

- Primary Color – Emerald Green (#4CAF50): Symbolizes financial growth, sustainability, and trust. This refined green tone reflects the intelligence and efficiency of SmartCart AI while maintaining a fresh, professional appearance.
- Secondary Color – Soft Ivory (#F5F7F3): A subtle off-white base that promotes clarity and focus, ensuring data and insights remain the visual centerpiece without overwhelming the user.
- Accent Color – Warm Gold (#D4AF37): Used sparingly to emphasize interactive elements such as call-to-action buttons, key metrics, and financial insights. Represents success, savings, and achievement.
- Headings: *Poppins* (Sans-serif) – Clean, modern, and authoritative, suitable for data labels and dashboard titles.
- Body Text: *Inter* (Sans-serif) – Highly legible and balanced, ensuring comfort in reading reports, analytics, and recommendations.
- Utilize consistent, minimalist vector icons with soft edges. Icons should visually align with the financial and grocery optimization themes, maintaining a balance between sophistication and simplicity.
- Maintain a clean grid structure with ample white space for visual hierarchy and readability. Prioritize data clarity through well-organized dashboards featuring responsive, interactive charts and graphs. Avoid visual clutter—each element should serve a functional or informational purpose.
- Employ subtle transitions for budget updates, graph changes, and AI-generated insights to enhance the perception of smooth intelligence. Use fade-ins, slide transitions, and progress animations that reinforce trust and precision without distracting from the content.
